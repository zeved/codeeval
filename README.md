# CodeEval.com
my CodeEval.com solutions in various languages.

-I do not claim these solutions to be the most optimal ones. I am just experimenting and hopefully evolving in my skill.
-tried writing in C but _there be dragons_ so I stick with Python3 for the moment. I may submit challenges in other languages (Java / C#)
